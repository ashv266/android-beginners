# Running slides locally

These slides are intended to be hosted online, like on github pages. While you are working on them it is helpful to run locally so that you can verify changes before committing and pushing to github.

To run the slides locally and monitor source files for changes ```grunt serve``` then head over to a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the live slides.
